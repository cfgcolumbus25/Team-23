An Automation and Visualization Dashboard

## Main Features
Institutions: An automation feature that sends emails to institutions with a magic link to fill out their updated information.

The information is then stored in the system and utilized to inform a visualized dashboard for students.

Learners: A dynamic visualization tool for students to see schools they are able to be a fit for based on their major, CLEP exam they took, and credit cuts 

The dashboard helps students see the not just list of universities, but their zipcodes, and locations in a visually appealing way. (User Experience is prioritised)
